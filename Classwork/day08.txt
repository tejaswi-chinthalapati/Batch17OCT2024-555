We use elseif ladder when we want to test other than numeric/single char i.e string,float
Switch is used only for checking numeric/single char (ascii character)

switch(cond)
{
   case 1: 
		--
		break;
   case 2: 
		--
		break;
   default:
		--
		break;( it is not necessary when default is at end but when default is at start then it must be present)

}
If break is not given in case then the immediate case will get executed
We cannot have duplicate cases in switch but in else if ladder we can have

It cannot take duplicates bcoz it forms a table of unique values(switch table) and internal binary search happens 
so that it directly goes to that case.

Process excited normally---> cleared residual memory or clear everything 
we can directly take the input in switch(input)



Loop:
------
1. initialize variable
2. cond check
3. sts to be executed
4. counter

3 types:
1. do while
2. while
3. for

2 category 
1. entry control
2. exit control

   do
    {

    }while(cond);

if scanf hasnt worked properly then we have to handle the error

We need to define macros when we use numerics like 0 or 1
Why theres a semicolon at the end of do while?


For loop
=========

For loop is more powerful than while loop bcoz in initialize section we can have multiple variables
and also we can have multiple counters and also multiple conditional sts

Moreover in a singleline we can get all the things done and easy to understand

We can ommit one or more section
